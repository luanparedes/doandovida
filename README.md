# doandovida
Course conclusion project.

This project is about to easy know about blood donations.
A project with more connection between hospitals and donators, where the user will know
the blood type needed, the closest place to donate and the dates.

In this project, the user have a virtual donator card, which can be showed when needed.
The user will have images to show in social media that he/she is a donator, and that others can be too.

We have the idea to do a recompensate points feature, which the idea is to recompensate the user with
points every donation, and these points can be changed by coupons in stores, streaming, etc.
